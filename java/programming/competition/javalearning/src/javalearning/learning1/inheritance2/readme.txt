If I have an Interface of 100 Methods in which i want to implement 2 methods in my class How can i do that.
I need to Create object to call those Method.No abstract as i can't create object reference.

How can i add new method in interface without implementing that method in class?

Results when the subclass object reaches to the super class method. It will
display the super class private data as well.
